# FLOSScoach
We are a community aimed to help newcomers get into *Free/Libre Open Source Software* (FLOSS). FLOSScoach helps by providing a way to organize the information, 
benefiting newcomers to avoid or overcome the most common barriers they face according to the research literature. The tool enables the inclusion of information
about existing projects in a standardized way, making it easier for newcomer to get used to the contribution flow.

FLOSSCoach portal has individual project pages, foruns and messages where you can exchange relevant information about OSS with newcomers so they can start contributing

You can use FLOSScoach by accessing [www.flosscoach.com](http://www.flosscoach.com)
